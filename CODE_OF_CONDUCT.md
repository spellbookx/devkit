## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of every individual, regardless of race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical appearance, neurodiversity, disability, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, religion or philosophy, national or social origin, socio-economic status, level of education, or any other personal characteristic. The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who engages in good faith and in accordance with this Covenant.

## Encouraged Behaviors

Recognizing that cultural and linguistic differences may affect how words and actions are perceived, we agree to strive toward behaviors that strengthen our community:

- Respecting the **purpose of our community**, our activities, and our ways of gathering.
- Engaging **kindly, honestly, and constructively** with others.
- Valuing and respecting **different viewpoints** and lived experiences.
- **Taking responsibility** for our words, actions, and contributions.
- Giving and receiving **constructive feedback gracefully**.
- Committing to **repairing harm** when it occurs.
- Acting in ways that promote the **health and well-being** of the community.

## Unacceptable Behaviors

The following behaviors are considered violations of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Harassment** — Ignoring clear boundaries or directing unwanted personal attention toward others.

6. **Endangerment** — Encouraging, threatening, or causing physical or psychological harm.

## Reporting an Issue

Conflict is inevitable, but not all conflict constitutes a Code of Conduct violation. This Covenant provides standards to help minimize harm and guide resolution.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it promptly by utilizing **GitHub's Private Security Advisory** feature on this repository's **Security** tab.

Reports will be handled with seriousness and care. Community Moderators will:

- Review all reports thoroughly, gathering context through logs, messages, interviews, and other relevant information.
- Act promptly while balancing **transparency, confidentiality, and safety**.
- Share enforcement actions only with the involved parties unless broader communication is part of a mutually agreed resolution.

## Enforcement & Remedies

If the Community Moderators determine that this Code of Conduct has been violated, they may apply one or more of the following measures. Depending on severity, steps may be escalated without warning:

1. **Warning**
   - _Event:_ A single violation or first incident.
   - _Action:_ A private written warning.
   - _Repair:_ Acknowledgement of responsibility, apology, or clarification.

2. **Limited Participation**
   - _Event:_ Repeated or more serious violation.
   - _Action:_ Temporary restriction from certain channels, discussions, or interactions.
   - _Repair:_ Reflection, apology, and preparation for reintegration.

3. **Temporary Suspension**
   - _Event:_ Serious or repeated violations.
   - _Action:_ Temporary removal with conditions for return.
   - _Repair:_ Fulfillment of those conditions and demonstrated commitment to community norms.

4. **Permanent Ban**
   - _Event:_ Severe or repeated violations that cannot be resolved through other remedies.
   - _Action:_ Removal from all community spaces and activities.
   - _Repair:_ None applicable.

This enforcement ladder is a guideline; moderators may exercise judgment in choosing appropriate measures to protect the community.
